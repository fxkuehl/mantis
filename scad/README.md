# Mantis Keycap Recommendations

I created two types of keycaps:

- [Flat with 15째 tilt](./keycap-v2-15-solid.stl) for most keys (24 keys per keyboard)
- [Tall with 28째 tilt and flattened top](./keycap-v3-28-solid.stl) for top row and some of the thumb keys (16 keys per keyboard)

The two links above take you to the STL files to use for 3D printing. There are [additional](./keycap-v2-15.stl) [variants](./keycap-v3-28.stl) with small holes for letting LEDs shine through. Light resin keycaps are translucent enough without the holes. But they are needed if you want to see RGB lights with black resin, nylon or other opaque plastic keycaps.

There are also STL files that combine 10 keycaps in a single STL model, which may allow cheaper printing with some manufacturers, depending on their minimum per-part cost. This may negatively affect the quality of the print. See [this article](https://kbd.news/Mantis-keycaps-2157.html) for more details.

It is possible to build an entire keyboard with only the 15째 keycaps. The top row will be a slightly longer reach, but it will still be quite comfortable to type on.

My original plan was to use the tall 28째 keycaps on the bottom row as well. But I find that flat keys work better for curling my fingers and lead to less finger movement.

Finally, Mantis is still compatible with [FK Keycaps HEX](https://fkcaps.com/keycaps/hex) keycaps. These are the keycaps that inspired me to design this keyboard in the first place. But I would not recommend them for the most comfortable and efficient typing experience any more.
